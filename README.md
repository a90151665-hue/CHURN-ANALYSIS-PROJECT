Customer Churn Data Analysis


This project focuses on analyzing customer churn data to identify key patterns, trends, and insights that influence why customers leave a business. The analysis was performed using Python (Google Colab) for data cleaning and EDA, and an interactive Power BI dashboard was created to visualize the findings.

The goal of this project is to help businesses understand customer behavior, monitor churn trends, and support decision-making to improve retention strategies.
